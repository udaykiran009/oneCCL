oneAPI Collective Communications Library
=========================================
   
oneAPI Collective Communications Library (oneAPI CCL) is a library that provides an efficient implementation of
communication patterns used in deep learning. 

The most popular features are:

- Built on top of lower-level communication middleware â€“ MPI and libfabrics.
- Optimized to drive scalability of communication patterns by allowing to easily trade-off compute for communication performance.
- Enables a set of DL-specific optimizations, such as prioritization, persistent operations, out of order execution, etc.
- Works across various interconnects: oneAPI Omni-Path Architecture, InfiniBand*, and Ethernet.
- Common API that supports Deep Learning frameworks (Caffe*, nGraph*, Horovod*, etc.)

oneAPI CCL package comprises the oneAPI CCL Software Development Kit (SDK) and the oneAPI MPI Library Runtime components.

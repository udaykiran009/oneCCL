=======================================================
   
|product_full| (|product_short|) provides an efficient implementation of communication patterns used in deep learning. 

|product_short| features include:

- Built on top of lower-level communication middleware â€“ |mpi|_ and `libfabrics <https://github.com/ofiwg/libfabric>`_.
- Optimized to drive scalability of communication patterns by allowing to easily trade off compute for communication performance.
- Enables a set of DL-specific optimizations, such as prioritization, persistent operations, or out-of-order execution.
- Works across various interconnects: Intel(R) Omni-Path Architecture, InfiniBand*, and Ethernet.
- Provides common API sufficient to support communication workflows within Deep Learning / distributed frameworks (such as PyTorch*, Horovod*).

|product_short| package comprises the |product_short| Software Development Kit (SDK) and the Intel(R) MPI Library Runtime components.

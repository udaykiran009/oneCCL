Prerequisites
=============

Before you start using the IntelÂ® CCL, make sure to set up the library environment. Use the command:
``$ source <install_dir>/intel64/bin/icclvars.sh``

Here and below, ``<install_dir>`` is the Intel(R) CCL installation directory, which is ``/opt/intel/iccl``
by default.

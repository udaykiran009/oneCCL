Before you start using |product_short|, make sure to set up the library environment. 
There are two ways to set up the environment:

- Using standalone |product_short| package installed into ``<ccl_install_dir>``:

    .. prompt:: bash

        source <ccl_install_dir>/setvars.sh


- Using |product_short| from |base_tk| installed into ``<toolkit_install_dir>`` (``/opt/intel/inteloneapi`` by default):

    .. prompt:: bash

        source <toolkit_install_dir>/setvars.sh

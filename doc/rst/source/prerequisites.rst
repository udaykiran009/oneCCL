Prerequisites
=============

Before you start using oneCCL, make sure to set up the library environment. There are two ways:

- Using standalone oneCCL package:

    .. prompt:: bash

        source <installdir>/bin/cclvars.sh

    Here ``<installdir>`` is the oneCCL installation directory.

- Using oneCCL from IntelÂ® oneAPI Base Toolkit:

    .. prompt:: bash

        sourse <installdir>/setvars.sh

    Here ``<installdir>`` is the oneCCL installation directory (``/opt/intel/inteloneapi`` by default).

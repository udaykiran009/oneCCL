Prerequisites
=============

Before you start using oneCCL, make sure to set up the library environment. 
With oneCCL being installed into ``<installdir>``, there are two ways to set up the environment:

- Using standalone oneCCL package:

    .. prompt:: bash

        source <installdir>/setvars.sh


- Using |product_short| from |base_tk|:

    .. prompt:: bash

        sourse <installdir>/setvars.sh

    By default, ``<installdir>`` is ``/opt/intel/inteloneapi``.

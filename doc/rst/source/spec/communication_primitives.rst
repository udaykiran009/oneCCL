Collective Opertations
======================

|product_full| introduces the following list of communication primitives:

- `Allgatherv`_
- `Allreduce`_
- `Reduce`_
- `Alltoall`_
- `Barrier`_
- `Broadcast`_

These operations are collective, meaning that all participants of oneCCL communicator should make a call.

Allgatherv
**********

Allgatherv is a collective communication operation that collects data from all processes within oneCCL communicator. 
Each participant gets the same result data. Different participants can contribute segments of different sizes.

**C version of oneCCL API:**

::

    ccl_status_t ccl_allgatherv(
        const void* send_buf,
        size_t send_count,
        void* recv_buf,
        const size_t* recv_counts,
        ccl_datatype_t dtype,
        const ccl_coll_attr_t* attr,
        ccl_comm_t comm,
        ccl_stream_t stream,
        ccl_request_t* req);

Alltoall
********

oneCCL Alltoall is an extension of oneCCL Allgather for cases when each process
sends different data to each receiver. The :math:`j`-th block sent from the process :math:`i` is received
by the process :math:`j` and is placed in the :math:`i`-th block of ``recvbuf``.
For each pair of processes the amount of sent data must be equal to 
the amount of received data.

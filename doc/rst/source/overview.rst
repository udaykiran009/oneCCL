Overview
============================

Intel® oneAPI Collective Communications Library (Intel® CCL) is a library that provides an efficient implementation of
communication patterns used in deep learning. 

Intel(R) CCL features include:

- Built on top of lower-level communication middleware – MPI and libfabrics.
- Optimized to drive scalability of communication patterns by allowing to easily trade-off compute for communication performance.
- Enables a set of DL-specific optimizations, such as prioritization, persistent, operations, out of order execution, etc.
- Works across various interconnects: Intel® Omni-Path Architecture, InfiniBand*, and Ethernet.
- Common API suitable for popular Deep Learning frameworks (Caffe*, nGraph*, Horovod*, etc.)

Overview
============================

oneAPI Collective Communications Library (oneAPI CCL) is a scalable and high-performance communication library for Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) workloads. It develops the ideas originated in Intel(R) Machine Learning Scaling Library and expands the design and API to encompass new features and use cases.

oneAPI CCL features include:

- Built on top of lower-level communication middleware – MPI and libfabrics.
- Optimized to drive scalability of communication patterns by allowing to easily trade-off compute for communication performance.
- Enables a set of DL-specific optimizations, such as prioritization, persistent, operations, out of order execution, etc.
- Works across various interconnects: oneAPI Omni-Path Architecture, InfiniBand*, and Ethernet.
- Common API suitable for popular Deep Learning frameworks (Caffe*, nGraph*, Horovod*, etc.)

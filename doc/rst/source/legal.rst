   * - Optimization Notice  
   * - Intel's compilers may or may not optimize to the same degree for    
       non-Intel microprocessors for optimizations that are not unique to  
       Intel microprocessors. These optimizations include SSE2, SSE3, and  
       SSSE3 instruction sets and other optimizations. Intel does not      
       guarantee the availability, functionality, or effectiveness of any  
       optimization on microprocessors not manufactured by Intel.          
       Microprocessor-dependent optimizations in this product are intended 
       for use with Intel microprocessors. Certain optimizations not       
       specific to Intel microarchitecture are reserved for Intel        
       microprocessors. Please refer to the applicable product User and    
       Reference Guides for more information regarding the specific       
       instruction sets covered by this notice.

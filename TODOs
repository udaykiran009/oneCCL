ooo: split comm_id space on internal/external to ensure the same comm_id accross ranks, remove persistent/temporal sched types, remove unresolved_comms - resolve comm on first access from app level, don't use partial_scheds[0] for bcast sched, replace tensor_comm_entry by abstract function_entry
general: avoid direct usage of global variables. Pass pointer/reference to the global variable from high level calls (API functions) and propagate them to the place of usage.

# oneAPI Collective Communications Library (oneCCL)

oneAPI Collective Communications Library (oneCCL) provides an efficient implementation of communication patterns used in deep learning.

oneCCL is integrated into:
* [Horovod\*](https://github.com/horovod/horovod) (distributed training framework). Refer to [Horovod with oneCCL](https://github.com/horovod/horovod/blob/master/docs/oneccl.rst) for details.
* [PyTorch\*](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) (machine learning framework). Refer to [PyTorch bindings for oneCCL](https://github.com/intel/torch-ccl) for details.

## Prerequisites

Ubuntu* 18
GNU*: C, C++ 4.8.5 or higher.

### SYCL support
Intel(R) oneAPI DPC++ Compiler with L0 v1.0 support

## Installation
### General installation scenario

```
cd oneccl
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j install
```

If a "clear" build is needed, then one should create a new build directory and invoke `cmake` within it.

### Specify installation directory
Modify `cmake` command as follow:

```
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/installation/directory
```

If no `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` is specified then ccl will be installed into `_install` subdirectory of the current
build directory, e.g. `ccl/build/_install`

### Specify compiler
Modify `cmake` command as follow:

```
cmake .. -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=your_c_compiler -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=your_cxx_compiler
```

### Specify `SYCL` cross-platform abstraction level
If your CXX compiler requires SYCL, it is possible to specify it (CodePlay ComputeCpp and DPC++ are available for now).
Modify `cmake` command as follows:

```
cmake .. -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=your_c_compiler -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=compute++ -DCOMPUTE_RUNTIME=computecpp
cmake .. -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=your_c_compiler -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=dpcpp -DCOMPUTE_RUNTIME=dpcpp
```

OpenCL search location path hint can be specified by using standard environment ``OPENCLROOT`` additionally:

```
OPENCLROOT=your_opencl_location cmake .. -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=your_c_compiler -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=compute++ -DCOMPUTE_RUNTIME=computecpp
```

### Specify build type
Modify `cmake` command as follow:

```
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=[Debug|Release|RelWithDebInfo|MinSizeRel]
```

### Enable `make` verbose output
Modify `make` command as follow to see all parameters used by `make` during compilation
and linkage:

```
make -j VERBOSE=1
```

### Build with address sanitizer
Modify `cmake` command as follow:
```
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DWITH_ASAN=true
```
*Note:* address sanitizer only works in Debug build

Make sure that libasan.so exists.

## Usage

### Launching Example Application
Use the command:
```
$ source <install_dir>/env/setvars.sh
$ cd <install_dir>/examples
$ mpirun -n 2 ./benchmark/benchmark
```
### Setting workers affinity
There are two ways to set workers threads affinity - explicit and automatic

#### Setting affinity explicitly
1. Set environment variable *CCL_WORKER_COUNT* with desired number of workers threads
2. Set environment variable *CCL_WORKER_AFFINITY* with IDs of cores to be bound to

Example:
```
export CCL_WORKER_COUNT=4
export CCL_WORKER_AFFINITY=3,4,5,6
```
With variables above CCL will create 4 threads and pin them to cores with numbers 3,4,5 and 6 accordingly

#### Setting affinity automatically
*NOTE:* automatic pinning only works if application has been launched using *mpirun* provided by CCL distribution package.

1. Set environment variable *CCL_WORKER_COUNT* with desired number of workers threads
2. Set environment variable *CCL_WORKER_AFFINITY* with value *auto*

Example:
```
export CCL_WORKER_COUNT=4
export CCL_WORKER_AFFINITY=auto
```
With variables above CCL will create 4 threads and pin them to the last 4 cores available for the launched process.

The exact IDs of CPU cores depend on parameters passed to *mpirun*

## FAQ

### When do I need a clean build? When should I remove my favorite build directory?

In the most cases there is no need in removal of the current build directory. Just run `make` to
compile and link changed files. Only if one sees some suspicious build errors after significant
change in the code (e.g. after rebase or change of branch) then it is a hint to clean build directory.
